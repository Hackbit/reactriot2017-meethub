# Meethub

Meethub is a web application designed to find and meet tech peoples, to drink a beer or maybe more...

## Description

Meethub is an application listing techs near from your current position (or a position you have chosen) and matching with your languages pr√©ferences.

It uses github api (search/users and users) to match the users, and use both google geoloc api and google places to localize you.

It was realized during the [ReactRiot 2017](https://www.reactriot.com/) competition in 48hours by 3 techs (cf authors).
