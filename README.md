Meethub is a static web application designed to find and meet tech peoples, to drink a beer or maybe more...

## Description

Meethub is an application (static) listing techs near from your current position (or a position you have chosen) and matching with your languages preferences.

It uses github api (search/users and users) to match the users, and use both google geoloc api and google places to localize you.

It was realized during the [ReactRiot 2017](https://www.reactriot.com/) competition in 48hours by 3 techs (cf authors).

## The Team

A team composed by 2 old react warriors with a third little young baby comes to make a pretty react application, fast, and easy guys.

Our philosophy is to make our own design (without using bootstrap-style one) and to work in a agile style with small releases realized quickly.

## Installation

Everyone can run the app on his own system.

First clone the repo:  `git clone https://github.com/Hackbit/reactriot2017-meethub.git`

Install the dependencies:  `npm i`

Launch the application:  `npm start` or build it: `npm build`
